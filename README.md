# MCP Examples with Rig Framework

This repository contains examples for using MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and clients with the [Rig Rust framework](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig).

## About

I'm producing practical examples demonstrating MCP server and client implementations using Rig. New examples are added weekly, ranging from very simple to close-to-real-world use cases.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute or add your own examples! As long as they showcase MCP client or server usage with the Rig framework, all contributions are welcome.
